# Analyzing-E-Commerce-Data

In this project I have picked up an E-Commerce sales data from Kaggle that has sales of around 3000 products recorded over time. Each sales are associated with an unique product identification key and unique customer key. Moreover, the data has illustrate their customer's respective country.

My work here is divided into two parts. In first part I will summerise the sales and generate some valuable insights to project it on a Dashboard. I believe, it would help the stakeholders (though it is an independent work)

Secondly, I will use Machine Learning technique to segement the customers in a meaningfull clusters and predict if a customer is likely to churn or not.

The overview of the data,

Invoice No: A unique key to identify each sales
Stock Code: A unique identifier of a product
Description: A string describing the nature of a product
Quantity: No. of items ordered in the invoice
Invoice Date: Date of purchase
Unit Price: Amount spent by the customer
Customer ID: A unique identification for customers
Country: Origin of the customer
